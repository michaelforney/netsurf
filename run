# This is just script for testing the browser quickly on
# a local html-file. Relative paths seem not work in the
# framebuffer frontend, so replace with the path to the
# html-page in your installation. Also, you might have
# another binary name, depending on architecture.
#
# The direction of stdout and stderr is to specific rio
# rio windows (cat /dev/winid to see the id of a window).
# Stderr gets a lot of debug info if run with option "-v"
# before the filename.


# Example of loading a local page (stderr to window no. 2)
#8.nsfb file:///usr/XXX/somepage.html >[2]/dev/wsys/2/cons

# Run the browser with logging enabled
#8.nsfb -v >[2]/dev/wsys/34/cons

# Go directly to a webpage
#8.nsfb http://www.9front.org >[2]/dev/null

# Start with the welcome screen:
8.nsfb >[2]/dev/null
